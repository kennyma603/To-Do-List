To Do List

Demo: http://kennyma.ca/demo/calendar/

a little app that I worked on in the last few day.

It is a small Calendar + To Do list App.

It can also pull weather forecast data (within 7 days) from yahoo weather API after you selected a date. 

JS is coded in a OOP way.

My Next goal is to use BackBone to rewrite this app in MVC fasion.
